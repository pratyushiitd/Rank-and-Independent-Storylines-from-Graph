Command line arguement after compiling the file Graph.java
$java Graph nodes.csv edges.csv function

nodes.csv contains all the nodes of your graph
edges.csv contains all the edges present in the graph
function can be : average , rank or independent_storylines_dfs

(a) Function: average. Should print the average number of neighbours each node is
associated with, as a float upto two decimal places.
Sample random output:
$java assignment4 nodes.csv edges.csv average

(b) Function: rank. Should print a sorted list of all nodes, with comma as delimiter. 
Nodes with more co-occurrences appear before. If there is a tie between
nodes based on co-occurrence count, then the order should be descending based on
lexicographic order of the node strings.

$java assignment4 nodes.csv edges.csv rank

(c) Function: independent_storylines_dfs.To extract independent storylines,
that have no edge across them, using DFS. Nodes are printed in each independent storyline, as a
separate line in the output.
The largest storyline (with maximum characters) will appear at the top, followed by the second
largest and so on. Within each line, the character names are delimited with comma, and
lexicographically sorted in descending order. If two storylines have same number of characters,
ties is broken in lexicographically descending order of character names.
